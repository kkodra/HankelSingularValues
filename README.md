# HankelSingularValues    
Code implements an efficient algorithm for computing precisely the Hankel singular values of linear singularly perturbed systems. The algorithm is obtained in terms of reduced-order equations and avoids numerical ill-conditioning typically associated with singularly perturbed systems when the singular perturbation parameter is very small.

Implementation is based on the following.
